			<p>HI !! My name is Edouard Puppo. I was born and raised in France.</p>

			 <p>When I was 16 I decided to undertake an exchange year on the other side of the planet in Sydney Australia. This experience opnened my eyes on the world and its different assets. This is when I knew I wanted to lead an international life. I have travelled a lot throughout my life. </p>
			 <p>I am now a business student at <a href="https://www.essec.edu/en/" target="_blank">ESSEC Business School</p>

			<h2>BEING AN ESSEC STUDENT</h2>
			<p> At ESSEC I have found some of my best friends. We moved in together in front of ESSEC. I am part of ESSEC España. I am at the networking pole which means I have to contact restaurant and associations in order to create event to contribute to the ESSEC student life on Cergy Campus. <p/>

			<p> ESSEC was not my first choice when choosing my future academic path. I was firstely intrested in Political Sciences, but I now realize that I made the right decision. I enjoy taking part of the associative life on the campus, as well as the different subjects. My favourite class would be Communication Skills because it is highly linked with my work at <a href="https://yfu.org" target="_blank">Youth For Understanding.</p>

			<h2>VOLUNTEERING</h2>
			<p> When I was sixteen I decided to undertake an exchange year abroad. This year has permitted me to acquire a fluent level of English, as well as maturity, independency and open-mindedness. During this gap year I followed an Australian high-school program with a diverse field of study. </p>

			<p>When returning from my exchange year I decided to dedicate myself to help other inbounds as well as outbounds students in the process of undertaking an experience such as this.</p>

			<p>I have travelled to Spain to follow a training course about cultures and integration when going to live abroad. This summer I had the opportunity to be flown to Oslo, Norway in order to entertain an arrival orientation seminar. </p>
